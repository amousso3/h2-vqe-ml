# H₂ VQE + ML Regression

This mini-project demonstrates how to:

- Simulate the ground state energy of the hydrogen molecule (H₂) using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in Qiskit.
- Generate training data by varying bond distances and recording energies.
- Train a regression model (using PyTorch or scikit-learn) to predict energy based on bond length.
